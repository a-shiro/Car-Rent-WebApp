      <h1>Terms And Conditions</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Confirming your booking and taking payment</h2>
        <p>
          After receiving your rental request, we will have to check the
          availability of the car and if possible we will send the confirmation
          quickly. If the conditions are favorable, we will ask you to send us
          your personal documents (Passport, Driving License) and we will send
          an "Authorization Form" to withdraw the money on the credit card or
          send the payment link where the customer can pay independently without
          sending to we credit card. Some rentals may require you to lock the
          security deposit on your credit card at least one day before the
          rental. In this case it is mandatory to send the filled and signed
          authorization form in order to proceed with pre-authorization. You
          will not have a contract until we have confirmed your booking and
          taken the payment. We will send all correspondence to the address
          provided when making the booking. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
          in these terms shall entitle any third party to any benefit or rights
          pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

        <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>
          Although we strive to ensure the accuracy of the information on this
          website, neither we nor our affiliates, suppliers or agents can be
          held responsible by you for the accuracy of such information. It is
          solely your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness and
          usefulness of all information provided on this website. We will not be
          held responsible for anyone driving under the influence of
          alcohol/drugs, causing willful damage, driving off-road or driving
          without due care and attention. You, will accept full responsibility
          in respect of such claims. This list is not exhaustive. What is
          included / excluded in the price? Please read the specific terms &
          conditions relating to your car hire, which you will see during the
          booking process.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Fuel & Deposits at the Car Hire Counter</h2>
        <p>
          Provided the car and extras are returned in the same state as rented
          and in accordance with the fuel policy, this deposit will be refunded
          after dropping the car off (please note that it may take up to 30 days
          for the money to appear on your credit card again). Some car hire
          companies will require you to return the car with the same amount of
          fuel it had in the tank at pick-up. Others operate a fuel policy where
          you, must purchase the first tank of fuel and may drop the car off
          empty – in which case, there may be no refund for unused fuel. Where
          the car hire company charges for fuel, the cost may be higher than it
          would be at a local petrol station.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Out-of-Hours Service</h2>
        <p>
          At most airport locations, flights will be met and cars supplied
          outside normal working hours. However, there may be an additional
          charge for this service, which will be payable directly to the car
          hire company. We will advise you whether a charge will apply when you
          confirm your pick-up times in your booking request. In the event that
          a flight delay causes the car pick-up to fall outside a car hire
          company’s normal working hours, the car hire company may agree to
          provide an out-of-hours service – in which case they will advise you
          of any fee. We can accept no further responsibility where there is no
          out-of-hours service available – and it is therefore recommended that
          you take independent travel insurance. Non-airport car hire counters
          may also provide an out-of-hours service.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Minimum / Maximum Age Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          In most locations, the minimum hiring age is 21 years. Additional fees
          can apply with certain car hire companies and in certain countries for
          drivers aged under 25 years or over 65 years: where the correct driver
          age has been submitted with the booking request, we will advise of any
          likely fees. Minimum age requirements on larger cars may also be
          higher at some locations. Please check with our Contact Centre if you
          have any questions or concerns about this matter. Minimum age for
          “sport” cars is 25 years.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>One-Way Rentals</h2>
        <p>
          One-way rentals must be confirmed in advance and may be subject to
          one-way fees, payable to the car hire company. We will advise you of
          the approximate costs after we receive your booking request and
          receive confirmation from the car hire company regarding the one-way
          rental. Child Seats & Special Requests Child seats, roof racks (not
          available on some cars) and other ‘extra’ items are available on
          request in most locations, although they cannot be guaranteed. There
          is usually a fee payable to the car hire company. In most locations,
          child seats are required by law. Please note: rear seatbelts may not
          be provided in all cars. Please check with our Contact Centre
          regarding these items. Requests for these items should be made at the
          time of booking.

        <h2>Delivery rules</h2>
        <p>
          Some car hire companies will agree to deliver your car to / collect it
          from a specified address. If so, there may be a fee for this service,
          payable to the car hire company. We will advise you whether a fee will
          apply when you confirm your pick-up / drop-off times, along with the
          full address details, in your booking request. Please note: car hire
          companies generally do not deliver to or collect from private
          accommodation. Driving Areas Restrictions may be applicable when
          taking the hire car to a different country/state/island; our Contact
          Centre must therefore be advised at the time of booking whether you
          intend to do this. Additional documentation may be required and local
          charges may apply for travel to certain countries. Restrictions may
          also apply in remote areas such as the Australian outback; please
          check with our Contact Centre.
